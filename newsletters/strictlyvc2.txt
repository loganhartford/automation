Ali Partovi’s Neo Looks to Upend the Accelerator Model With Low-Dilution Terms

By Marina Temkin

Partovi, who is known for his early investments in Facebook, Cursor, and Kalshi, has just introduced Neo Residency, a new, competitively structured program that combines the firm’s now four-year-old accelerator with a track for current college students.

The terms that Neo Residency offers are so founder-friendly as to be “not even comparable to any other accelerator,” Partovi told TechCrunch.

For the cohort of 12 to 15 startups entering the program this summer, Neo will invest $750,000 via an uncapped SAFE — a contract that gives an investor future equity in exchange for money now, with no ceiling on the valuation used to calculate that stake. Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won’t receive its equity until the company’s next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo’s stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm’s ownership drops to just 0.75%.

“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.

In comparison, Y Combinator typically takes a fixed 7% of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup’ via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.
